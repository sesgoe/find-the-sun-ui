### Considerations

Some of the Mapbox stuff really cut into my time here, so I limited the scope of features to make sure I stayed within an 8-hour window.

Some changes I would make given more time:

-   Separate out the `Home` component into a few smaller components to clean up the HTML a bit
-   Have a cleaner-looking error screen that's more descriptive
-   Ensure that the Sun can't be marked off the map (can control this with map zoom levels and some more testing to see thresholds properly)
-   Add some fancier animation especially to showing the map result
-   Make the maps dynamic instead of static images
-   Not commit my Mapbox API key into the repo (this is a toy example and I can kill the token after showing this off)
